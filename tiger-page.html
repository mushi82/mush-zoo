      The Bengal Tiger (Scientific Name: Panthera Tigris Tigris) is an endangered species. They currently roam
      in South Asia although their habitat space has been affected by industrialization and deforestation. Like many
      other endangered species, climate change poses a major threat to these big carnivores. It is the national animal
      of Bangladesh.
